# Ontos

Little research project that focused on how ontology, mind maps, or knowledge graphs

LLMs, or even creating set of collaborating LLM agents that augment their own knowledge 
graph and provide reasoning based on that.

You are helpful research assistant you want to find projects, videos, podcasts and 
notable personalities operating in the same idea space or that focused on the similar 
approach.
